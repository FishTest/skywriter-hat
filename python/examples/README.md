Skywriter Examples
==================

mouse.py
--------

This example does exactly what you'd expect- gives you control over the mouse with Skywriter. It probably wont be much use out of the box, though, but it's a good proof of concept and a pointer in the right direction- make it better!

To install, you'll need to:

    sudo apt-get install python-dev python-xlib libxtst-dev python-pip

And:

    sudo pip install autopy


test.py
-------

Nothing exciting, simply outputs the variety of gestures, touches and movements that the Skywriter detects when you move your finger around above it.

* Airwheel - wave your finger in a circular pattern above the HAT
* Touch/Tap/Doubletap - touch, tap or double-tap one of the edges or the center of the HAT
* X/Y/Z - just move your finger over the HAT
* Gestures - try waving your hand from one side of the HAT to the other
